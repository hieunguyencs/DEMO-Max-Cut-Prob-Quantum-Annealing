# Demo Max Cut Problem using Dwave Quantum Annealer
> My first try with quantum annealing...

> This code clone code from https://github.com/dwave-examples/maximum-cut

> Need to get API token from Dwave Leap to run this code

## How to get an API token 

**If "it is not yet available for your region.."**

- Use a VPN service to change your location to USA or another country that Leap serves
- I use OperaGX (web browser) and use this doc to enable VPN: https://help.opera.com/en/latest/security-and-privacy/#VPN

After that, go to dashboard -> Expand your access -> Choose appropriate package (Developer package is fastest to apply and still be able to run this code)

Then use this API token to set up dwave.

## Note: 
- You can read/watch these ones to set up:  https://youtu.be/bErs0dxC1aY?si=eIRuHje3oTeQ86v4 or https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/getting_started.html
- You can use my API token (if still available: DEV-76d07a9aba2a6f51d2aea78fbf2916810081e4e5)
